# Fleet Fuel Consumption Dashboard 📊⛽

A data-driven and visually appealing dashboard that analyzes fleet fuel consumption patterns using real-world data. This project was developed using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, and provides actionable insights into fuel usage trends, asset efficiency, driver behavior, cost management, and external influencing factors like weather and maintenance.

## 📊 Dashboards Overview

### 1. General Fuel Overview
- Fuel consumption by fuel type (pie chart)
- Average fuel usage by asset type
- Monthly and weekly fuel usage trends

### 2. Weather Impact Dashboard
- Fuel consumption across different weather conditions
- Trip status vs weather (delays, cancellations)
- Fuel efficiency (L/km) under various weathers
- Heatmap of time per km by asset type & weather

### 3. Driver Efficiency Analysis
- Top 10 most fuel-efficient drivers (km/L)
- Cost per km for most and least expensive drivers
- Cost efficiency of the top fuel-efficient drivers

### 4. Asset Age & Maintenance Impact
- Asset age vs fuel consumption (regression plot)
- Maintenance status vs speed, fuel usage, and trip cost
- Asset type performance based on maintenance condition
